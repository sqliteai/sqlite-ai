description: >
  SQLite-AI is an extension for SQLite that brings artificial intelligence
  capabilities directly into the database. It enables developers to run,
  fine-tune, and serve AI models from within SQLite using simple SQL queries —
  ideal for on-device and edge applications where low-latency and offline
  inference are critical.
